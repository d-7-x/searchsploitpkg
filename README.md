# searchsploitpkg
This script will take the results from a package list (like a package list from linuxprivchecker/linenum) and loop through searchsploit to find any relevant exploits for each package.  The script will take the value before the first '-' (dash) or provided separator so you may wish to modify the more important packages like the linux kernel to avoid a broad search.
